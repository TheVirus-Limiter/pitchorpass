I need the following changes implemented to improve immersion, fix bugs, and align the UI with the physical “wood / whiteboard / sticky note” theme. This is not feature creep — these are polish + correctness fixes.

1. Add “Your Exposure Warning” under the ROI note

Location

Directly under the yellow “If exit hits $10M…” note

Same width, visually stacked like a second pinned sticky note

Purpose

This is psychological guidance, not a metric

It should update live as the investment slider moves

Content

Title (small, handwritten style):

Your Exposure


Dynamic copy (only show ONE line at a time):

Use remaining capital %, not total fund.

< 15% of remaining capital

“Diversified enough to survive misses.”

15–35%

“This would put X% of your remaining capital into one bet.”

35–55%

“High concentration — one failure hurts.”

> 55%

“You’re betting the fund on this.”

Visual style

Paper: off-white / manila

Text: charcoal / pencil gray

Accent: subtle red underline or ⚠ stamp

No bright colors or borders

2. Critical bug fixes (must be resolved)
Bug A — Graph changes when typing in “Ask” textbox

Expected behavior

Pitch data (valuation, projections, graph points) must be immutable once loaded

Typing or submitting a question must not:

regenerate pitch data

recompute projections

re-render graphs

Implementation rule

Asking a question can only update text UI — never pitch state.

Bug B — Founder response changes after appearing

Expected behavior

The founder should respond once and only once

After submission:

Disable the input immediately

Disable the Ask button immediately

Render the response exactly once

Never re-call or re-render

UX improvement

Stamp the response area with a small red “ANSWERED” mark so the lock feels intentional

3. Color system overhaul (major immersion issue)

The current UI uses too many unrelated colors (blue, green, yellow, red).
This feels like a dashboard, not a room.

New palette rules (mandatory)

Allowed materials

Wood (warm walnut / oak tones)

Paper (off-white, manila, light gray)

Ink (charcoal / graphite)

Accent red (stamps ONLY)

Remove entirely

Bright blues

Greens for success

Yellow alert boxes

Modern neon-style highlights

Usage rules

Numbers are black/graphite, not green

Risk is communicated via wording and stamps, not color blocks

Red is reserved for:

stamps (INVESTED, PASS, ANSWERED)

subtle warnings only

4. Typography cleanup
Fonts (max TWO)

Primary UI font

Inter / Source Sans 3 / IBM Plex Sans

Used for all body text, numbers, labels

Handwritten accent font

Caveat / Patrick Hand / Architects Daughter

Used ONLY for:

sticky notes

exposure warning

stamps

scribbles

No other fonts should appear.

5. Stamps & tactile elements (theme alignment)

Add physical-feeling cues:

Red ink stamps:

INVESTED

PASS

ANSWERED

Slight rotation, imperfect edges

Use stamps instead of color-coded buttons where possible

Buttons should feel like:

Paper cards

Pencil marks

Rubber stamps

Not modern SaaS buttons.

6. Homepage redesign (sticky notes + new copy)

The current homepage boxes feel AI-written and visually disconnected.

Visual changes

Replace the three boxes with three sticky notes

Slightly rotated, taped or pinned

Match the in-game material style

Copy (use EXACT text below)
Sticky Note 1 — AI-Generated Pitches
Every founder thinks their startup is special.

Some are right.
Most are wrong.

You’ll see the pitch, the traction, the valuation —
and decide whether it deserves your money.

Sticky Note 2 — Real Outcomes
Three years pass in minutes.

Some companies quietly succeed.
Some flame out.
A few surprise everyone.

Your returns depend on equity, timing,
and how much risk you were willing to take.

Sticky Note 3 — Investor Archetypes
At the end, you don’t just see a number.

You see what kind of investor you are —
careful, bold, reckless, lucky,
or something in between.


No rewriting, no marketing language, no buzzwords.

7. Implementation order (important)

Please do these in this order to avoid regressions:

Lock pitch data after load (fix graph + response bugs)

Apply new color + font system globally

Add Exposure Warning component

Redesign homepage boxes as sticky notes

Success criteria

When done, the app should:

Feel like sitting in a startup pitch room

Feel tactile and human, not AI-dashboardy

Make investment decisions feel risky and personal

Never change data unexpectedly due to UI input
