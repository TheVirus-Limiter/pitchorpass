PART 1 — HOMEPAGE
1. The “Start Investing” button is weak and generic

Problem

The button looks like a standard dark CTA.

It doesn’t feel like the beginning of a game or experience.

There’s no emotional pull.

Fix

Replace the button with something physical and expressive:

A large paper card or stamp-style button

Handwritten or marker-style arrow/text

Slight rotation / imperfect edges

Consider copy like:

“Take a seat”

“Hear the first pitch”

“Let’s begin”
(NOT marketing language)

The CTA should feel like entering a room, not clicking a product button.

2. Sticky notes are hard to read and not noteworthy

Problems

Text is too small.

Notes blend into the background.

They feel informational, not memorable.

Fix

Increase sticky note text size significantly.

Increase line spacing.

Make each note visually distinct:

Different rotation angles

Slight overlap

Clear tape/pin detail

Increase contrast slightly (darker ink, subtle shadow).

These notes should be readable from across the room and feel like something someone left behind intentionally.

3. Sticky notes still feel decorative, not essential

Problem

They feel optional, like flavor text.

They don’t command attention.

Fix

Make them feel like the rules of the game, not explanations.

They should visually compete with the title, not sit beneath it quietly.

Pull them closer to the center of the page so they feel unavoidable.

PART 2 — PITCH PAGE (RIGHT COLUMN ISSUES)
4. Founder Conviction is basically invisible

Problem

“Overconfident, buzzword-heavy” is too small.

There is no label or context.

A user would not know what this is unless they designed the game.

Fix

Explicitly label it:

Founder Conviction


Increase text size.

Present it as a margin note or callout, not inline text.

Optional styling:

Handwritten font

Pencil underline

Small red “NOTE” or “OBSERVATION” stamp

This is a core psychological mechanic. It must be obvious.

5. “Your Exposure” warning is too subtle

Problem

The exposure message is easy to miss.

It doesn’t create pause or tension.

There is too much unused space above and below it.

Fix

Turn “Your Exposure” into a full-height component in the right column.

Use:

Clear heading: “Your Exposure”

Larger text

More vertical spacing

Visually separate it from ROI:

Divider line

Tape/pin styling

Different paper shade

This section should feel like a quiet but serious warning.

6. Right column has too much dead space

Problem

Large areas of unused vertical space.

Important psychological cues are compressed while space is wasted.

Fix

Stretch the following to fill the column:

Founder Conviction

ROI note

Exposure warning

The right column should feel dense with decision pressure, not empty.

7. PASS / INVEST buttons still feel too modern

Problem

They still look like standard web buttons.

Green INVEST button feels like a default CTA.

Fix

De-modernize completely:

No green success color

No flat button styles

Replace with:

Paper tabs

Stamps

Pencil-written labels

Emotional feedback should come from:

Red “INVESTED” / “PASS” stamps

Slight shake / animation

Sound or visual imprint

Buttons should feel like actions taken, not clicks made.

PART 3 — CREATIVE DIRECTION REMINDER

This project should feel like:

A pitch meeting

A whiteboard

Notes, stamps, judgment, uncertainty

It should not feel like:

A SaaS product

A fintech dashboard

A metrics viewer

If something looks “clean but boring,” it’s probably wrong.

Definition of “done” for next iteration

Homepage immediately feels intriguing and human

Sticky notes are readable, bold, and intentional

Start action feels like entering a game, not clicking a CTA

Founder Conviction and Exposure are unmistakable and legible

Right column is filled with tension, not whitespace

No element feels like default UI
