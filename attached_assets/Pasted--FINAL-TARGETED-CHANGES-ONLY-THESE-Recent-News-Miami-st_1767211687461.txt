1. Graphs Still Feel Too Clean / Digital - for the 3 years later screen

The valuation graphs do not read as pencil-drawn yet.

Required changes

Switch graph styling to clearly hand-drawn:

Add slight jitter/noise to line paths

Vary stroke width subtly along the curve

Slightly uneven axis spacing and labels

Remove perfect curves — add micro-imperfections

Add end-of-line personality:

At Y5, add a small handwritten annotation depending on outcome:

Loss: “ran out of runway”, “couldn’t scale”

Win: “acquired quietly”, “finally took off”

Missed: “this was the one”

Include small hand-drawn arrows or circles near inflection points

Overall goal: the graph should look like it was sketched during a pitch, not generated by a chart library.

2. End / Investor Profile Screen Feels Empty

The final investor profile screen has too much unused space and not enough storytelling.

Required changes

Add one visual element to ground the page:

A small hand-drawn portfolio sketch (bars, dots, or pie)

Or a timeline showing “Early bets → Later bets”

Add decision context, not just totals:

Example blocks:

“Big wins: 2”

“Total misses: 3”

“Most impactful decision: [Company Name]”

Replace the generic quote with a specific reflection tied to outcomes, e.g.:

“One aggressive bet carried the entire portfolio.”

“Passing early cost more than the losses.”

The screen should feel like a post-mortem, not a stats card.

3. Forced-Pass Math (THIS IS CRITICAL)

Right now, it is still possible to invest in all final-round companies, which breaks the intended tension.

Phase 1 (already correct, keep as-is)

$100k starting capital

Minimums force at least one pass

Phase 2 (needs hard enforcement)

Capital entering Phase 2 is variable (based on Phase 1 performance), so the logic must scale dynamically.

Required rule

Let C = capital entering Phase 2

For 5 final companies:

Each company gets a dynamic minimum investment between 25%–40% of C

Ensure:

sum(minimums) = 1.15 × C   (±5%)


This guarantees:

User must pass on at least one final deal

Sometimes two, if they concentrate too early

UX requirement

When the user tries to invest in too many:

Show inline feedback like:

“You don’t have enough capital to back every late-stage deal.”
“Concentration is now a requirement.”

This should feel like a late-stage capital allocation squeeze, not a UI limitation.

4. Reveal Screens Flow (Minor but Important)

The reveal sequence works, but it needs slightly more pacing and clarity.

Required changes

Add a subtle transition between reveals:

Fade or slide with “3 years later…” staying faintly in background

Make the “Next Company” button feel intentional:

Slight delay (300–500ms) before it becomes clickable

Prevents rapid skipping and increases impact

Summary of Intent

Graphs must feel hand-drawn and human

End screen must tell a story, not just show numbers

Math must force difficult passes, even with strong performance

Late-stage should feel tighter, heavier, and more stressful than early stage🔧 FINAL TARGETED CHANGES (ONLY THESE)
