This homepage is closer conceptually, but the execution is still off. Right now it feels empty, oversized, and visually unbalanced, and the sticky notes don’t feel intentional. Please fix the following.

1. The page feels empty and vertically stretched

Problem

There is too much empty space above and below the main content.

The title, subtitle, and CTA feel disconnected from the notes.

The page feels like a landing page template, not a room.

Fix

Pull the sticky notes higher, closer to the CTA.

Reduce vertical spacing between:

Title

Subtitle

Start Investing button

The page should feel contained, like a board you’re standing in front of.

2. Sticky notes feel decorative, not interactive

Problems

Notes are too evenly spaced.

Rotation is too subtle.

They feel pasted on, not placed.

Fix

Increase rotation variance (each note should clearly tilt differently).

Slightly overlap at least one note.

Add clearer tape/pin details so they feel physically attached.

Increase shadow depth just a bit so they “lift” off the background.

These should feel like someone casually stuck them there.

3. Sticky note text is too small and cramped

Problem

Text is hard to read at a glance.

Line spacing is tight.

This undermines the handwritten feel.

Fix

Increase sticky note body text size.

Increase line height.

Let the notes breathe — they don’t need to be compact.

These are story elements, not tooltips.

4. Title hierarchy needs adjustment

Problem

“10 Pitches” is very large, but the context underneath feels weak.

The subtitle reads like marketing copy.

Fix

Slightly reduce the title size.

Make the supporting text feel calmer and more confident.

Avoid emphasis colors (no green highlight on $100,000).

Everything should be ink-colored, not highlighted.

5. CTA button still looks like a modern web button

Problem

The “Start Investing” button feels like a generic product CTA.

It clashes with the analog theme.

Fix

Make the button feel more physical:

Paper texture

Slightly imperfect edges

Optional arrow drawn like marker, not an icon

Reduce saturation — it should attract attention without screaming.

6. The floating icon at the top feels random

Problem

The circular icon above the title has no context.

It feels decorative and unnecessary.

Fix

Either remove it entirely or

Integrate it meaningfully (e.g., stamped icon, sketch, or badge)
If it doesn’t add meaning, it shouldn’t be there.

7. Extra sticky notes at the edges are distracting

Problem

The blank sticky notes in the corners feel like placeholders.

They add noise without purpose.

Fix

Remove them unless they serve a clear purpose.

Fewer elements will make the page feel more intentional.

8. Tone check — what this screen should feel like

This screen should feel like:

You’ve walked into a room

Someone laid out a challenge

Notes were left behind for you to read

You’re about to sit down and make decisions

It should not feel like:

A SaaS landing page

A marketing site

A product hero section

Definition of “done” for this screen

Sticky notes feel physical, readable, and deliberate

The page feels dense enough to be interesting, not empty

Nothing looks like default UI

The CTA feels like the start of a game, not a signup flow

Focus only on spacing, scale, and physicality for this iteration.
