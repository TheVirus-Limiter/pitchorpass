1. Sticky note emphasis (correction)
Title line

Keep the note title bold

Do NOT underline the title

Example:

Some founders are right.

Body text emphasis (move underlines here)

Apply underlines only in the body text, specifically to key phrases.
Use the following body copy exactly, with underlines applied where appropriate:

A lot of them aren’t.

You’ll see the pitch, the traction, and the valuation.

From there, it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth backing.


Underline emphasis should be subtle and selective (not every line).

2. “They’re asking / Seeking” section is broken and should be fixed

Problem

The “They’re asking” amount is misleading.

In some cases it says they’re asking for $37,500 but the user can invest $50k anyway.

This makes the field meaningless.

Fix

The maximum investment amount must be capped at 100% of what they’re asking.

If a founder is asking for $37,500:

The slider max = $37,500

The user cannot exceed it

If this constraint cannot be enforced cleanly, remove the “They’re asking” field entirely.

This number must always be respected or it should not exist.

3. Founder credentials — increase randomness and realism

Problem

Too many founders have top-tier credentials.

It’s becoming predictable.

Fix

Increase the frequency of:

Non-name universities

Regional schools

Less prestigious programs

Still include strong schools (Harvard, Stanford, UT Austin, etc.), but slightly less often.

Example mix:

“BS Computer Science, University of Houston”

“Economics, Arizona State”

“Self-taught developer”

“Dropped out after sophomore year”

Same rule for work history:

Mix big tech (Google, Microsoft) with:

Startups

Small agencies

Freelance / consulting

No prior experience

Credentials should influence perception, not give away outcomes.

4. Major game structure change: two-phase game

The game should now be split into two distinct phases.

Phase 1: Early-stage investing

5 pitches

Lower valuations (roughly what exists now)

You invest with your starting capital

After pitch 5:

Immediately resolve exits for those 5 companies

Show outcomes and update capital

Phase 2: Later-stage investing

5 new pitches

These companies are now valued in the millions

You invest using:

The money you made (or lost) from Phase 1

Stakes feel higher:

Larger checks

Smaller equity percentages

These are not repeats — entirely new companies

End of game

After Phase 2 exits resolve:

Show final outcomes

Archetype

Missed opportunities

Full summary

This structure creates:

Progression

Rising stakes

A clearer narrative arc

Summary of changes to implement

Move underlines from note titles → note body text

Enforce max investment = amount they’re asking

Increase frequency of non-name universities and non-big-tech backgrounds

Split the game into:

Phase 1: 5 early-stage pitches + exits

Phase 2: 5 later-stage pitches with higher valuations
