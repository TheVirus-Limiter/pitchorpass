Project update for the game “Pitch or Pass” — revise rules, content, and UI.

1) Valuations / equity / investment math (must be realistic and consistent)
- Startup valuations must be under $500,000, preferably around $100,000 (e.g., $60k–$400k range, most clustered near $100k–$200k).
- Founders will never offer more than 49% of their company total.
- When the player invests, equity % should be based on valuation: equity = investedAmount / valuation, capped so total equity offered never exceeds 49%.
- ROI must be proportional to equity. Example: invest $30k at $100k valuation = 30% equity. If exit = $10M, payout = $3M.
- Show equity clearly on-screen at decision time: valuation, ask, offered equity, post-money implied, etc.
- If the player runs out of money at any point, immediately skip to the “3 Years Later…” ending sequence (no more pitches).

2) Risk / volatility / outcomes (more variety)
- Do NOT make all startups “medium risk.” Each company must have its own risk level and volatility.
- Include a spectrum:
  - low-risk / modest return (steady businesses)
  - medium-risk / mixed outcomes
  - high-risk moonshots with huge upside but high failure chance (flying cars, meals-in-a-pill, etc.)
  - obviously terrible deals (e.g., 10 active users, no revenue, incoherent model)
- Outcomes should feel volatile and story-driven, not just a bland score. Failure should be common for high-risk.

3) Pitch content (more captivating)
- Startup ideas must be more eye-grabbing than generic “AI for X.”
- Include:
  - a few “crazy, probably impossible” moonshots with massive potential
  - several compelling, plausible startups with interesting twists
  - a few clearly bad startups the player should reject
- Pitches should be short but punchy (3–5 sentences), with strong hooks and memorable details.
- Traction must match the story (moonshots might have prototypes + hype; terrible ones have tiny traction).

4) One-question mechanic (interactive)
- Under each founder’s profile, give the player exactly ONE question to ask the entrepreneur.
- Implement as a simple chat input with a single message allowed.
- The AI response must be short and direct (1–2 sentences) and must only use the startup’s known pitch/traction info (no hallucinated “new facts”).
- After one question is used, disable it for that pitch.

5) “Recent news” tab (snippets per company)
- Add a “Recent News” tab for each startup with 2–4 short snippets/headlines about that company.
- Style it like press coverage from sites like Forbes, TechCrunch, BBC, etc.
Important constraint: do not scrape real websites in the client. Generate these snippets via the ChatGPT API to resemble those outlets’ tone, but clearly treat them as simulated/in-game press (avoid implying they are real links or real articles). Do not use real logos.

6) Ending sequence (much richer + case-specific)
- The ending should be an interactive “portfolio timeline” reveal, one company at a time, with animated money changes.
- Each company must have a specific outcome message (not only “massive success” or “failed”).
  Examples: “great product, failed execution,” “acquired but down-round,” “regulatory blocked,” “viral hype then churn,” “pivot saved them,” etc.
- Each company’s ending popup should include:
  - the outcome narrative
  - simulated news snippets referencing the outcome
  - your investment amount, equity %, exit value, and your payout (or loss)
- Add a “missed opportunity” insight line:
  - “If you had invested $X in [Company], you would have made $Y more.”
  - This should be computed from the simulated final outcomes.

7) Archetypes / success levels (more variety)
- Expand beyond a few archetypes. Include many archetypes and multiple success tiers.
- Archetype assignment should be based on actual behavior:
  - risk tolerance, diversification, capital efficiency, concentration, timing, etc.
- Provide a final “Investor Profile” screen with:
  - archetype name + short description
  - final capital vs starting capital
  - biggest win, biggest loss, best missed opportunity
  - replay button

8) Visual design (avoid “generic AI app look”)
- The UI should NOT look like a standard AI dashboard with the usual icons/colors.
- Theme it like a creative “wood + whiteboards + startup garage” space:
  - warm wood textures, paper notes, hand-drawn doodle accents, whiteboard panels
  - sticky notes for traction, stamps for “INVESTED” / “PASS”
  - subtle imperfections (tape, pins, marker strokes)
- Keep it readable and modern, but with personality and tactile feel.
- Avoid the typical neon gradients, generic flat icons, and repetitive AI color palettes.

9) Implementation constraints
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/vanilla JS.
- OpenAI key must not be exposed client-side; assume a backend proxy/serverless function.
- Use RandomUser API for founder identity.
- Use ChatGPT API for: pitches, traction, simulated news snippets, and one-question Q&A responses.

Deliverable from you:
- Update the game design + data model to reflect these rules.
- Provide the updated prompting strategy for pitch generation + news snippet generation + one-question answering.
- Provide the revised ROI/outcome simulation logic and the ending reveal flow.
- Provide concrete UI layout guidance aligned to the wood/whiteboard theme.
