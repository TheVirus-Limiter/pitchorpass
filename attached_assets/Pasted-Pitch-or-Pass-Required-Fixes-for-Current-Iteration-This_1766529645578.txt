Pitch or Pass — Required Fixes for Current Iteration

This build is moving in the right direction, but there are several glaring usability, clarity, and creativity issues that need to be addressed. Please treat the following as required changes, not suggestions.

PART 1 — PITCH PAGE FIXES
1. Risk Assessment needs color back (subtle, mood-setting)

Problem

Risk assessment is currently colorless and visually flat.

It does not set emotional context.

Fix

Add a very faint undertone based on risk:

High Risk → muted red tint

Medium Risk → muted yellow tint

Low Risk → muted green tint

This should be subtle, not loud, but clearly readable.

Risk should feel dangerous or safe at a glance.

2. Founder Conviction must be obvious and legible

Problems

The conviction text is too small.

There is no clear indication that this is a “Founder Conviction” signal.

Users would not understand this unless they designed the game.

Fix

Make the entire conviction block a sticky note with:

Clear label:
Founder Conviction

Larger text size

Color-code the entire sticky note based on conviction:

Green = strong / grounded

Yellow = mixed / uncertain

Red = overconfident / hand-wavy

This is a core mechanic and should be visually unavoidable.

3. Exposure Warning design is wrong

Problems

The current exposure warning looks like an error box.

It feels disconnected and weak.

There is still unnecessary space between it and PASS / INVEST.

Fix

Redesign Exposure Warning as a “Pro Tip” / advisory callout:

Label example:
Investor Note or Pro Tip

Softer styling (no harsh borders)

Increase text size and vertical presence.

Visually connect it to the decision area.

Remove dead space so the right column feels tight and pressurized.

4. PASS / INVEST buttons still feel too “web app”

Problems

PASS button is okay conceptually, but the button outline ruins it.

INVEST button feels generic and modern.

Fix

PASS

Remove the button container entirely.

Make it just a red stamp interaction.

INVEST

Use a clearly different visual language:

Green stamp / green ink

Or a heavier, decisive mark

It should feel like committing capital.

No flat buttons. These are actions, not UI controls.

5. Remove the lightning bolt near the founder photo

Problem

The lightning bolt icon has no clear meaning.

It adds visual noise and confusion.

Fix

Remove it entirely.

6. Graph needs color differentiation (and must stop changing)
A. Graph styling

Problem

Graph is too monotone and hard to parse.

Fix

Add subtle color variation:

Historical: graphite / neutral

Conservative: muted blue

Realistic: muted green

Optimistic: muted red

Use low saturation — this is a whiteboard sketch, not a dashboard.

B. Critical bug: graph changes when typing

Problem

Typing in the text input causes graph points to change.

Fix (non-negotiable)

Pitch data must be immutable once loaded.

Text input and “ask founder” interactions must never:

Regenerate pitch data

Recalculate projections

Re-render graph values

This bug has appeared multiple times and must be fully resolved.

7. “Round X/10” and “$X” displays look too modern

Problem

These indicators feel like SaaS UI elements.

Fix

Restyle them to match the theme:

Paper tags

Handwritten or stamped accents

Subtle color (ink, muted green, muted red)

They should feel like notations, not HUD elements.

8. Copy tweak

Change

Replace:

“Ask one question”

With:

“Ask the founder one question”

This is clearer and more human.

PART 2 — HOMEPAGE FIXES
9. Homepage still feels bland and empty

Problems

Too little background texture.

Too few visual anchors.

Feels like a landing page, not a space.

Fix

Add more background elements:

Faint paper layers

Extra notes, pins, tape, or board texture

The page should feel lived in.

10. Sticky note copy structure needs consistency

Problem

Only the first sticky note uses the strong “Every founder thinks…” pattern.

The other two feel like plain statements.

Fix

Rewrite the other two to match the same narrative structure.

They should read like assertive, opinionated sentences, not descriptions.

Example structure:

“Every investment looks obvious in hindsight.”

(Not asking for this exact copy, just the structure.)

11. Sticky note typography needs to change

Problems

Handwritten font is too soft and not impactful.

Notes don’t stand out.

Fix

Switch sticky note text to a more notable font (not handwritten).

Use:

Bold

Italics

Underlines
sparingly to add emphasis and rhythm.

These notes should be readable and memorable.

12. Bring back the green $100,000 box

Change

Restore the green highlighted box for $100,000.

This worked well visually and gave the user an immediate anchor.

Keep it subtle and on-theme.

13. “Take a seat” button does not read as a button

Problem

It looks like a piece of paper, not an action.

There’s no affordance.

Fix

Make it clearly clickable:

Stronger shadow

Clear edge

Bolder text

It should feel like starting the experience, not decoration.

FINAL DIRECTION REMINDER

This product should feel:

Creative

Opinionated

Physical

Slightly messy

Human

It should not feel:

Clean

Generic

Corporate

SaaS-like

Please focus on clarity, creativity, and emotional signaling in the next iteration — not polish for polish’s sake.
