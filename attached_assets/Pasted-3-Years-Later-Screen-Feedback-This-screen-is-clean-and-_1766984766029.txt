3 Years Later Screen — Feedback

This screen is clean and readable, but right now it feels too generic and underwhelming for what should be a big moment. This is one of the emotional peaks of the game, and it needs more personality and payoff.

What’s working

The layout is simple and easy to understand.

The gain amount is clear and readable.

The idea of revealing outcomes one by one is strong.

What needs improvement
1. “MASSIVE SUCCESS!” is too generic

That line feels placeholder-y and breaks immersion.

Instead of generic labels like:

“MASSIVE SUCCESS”

“FAILED TO EXECUTE”

Use specific, human outcome lines, for example:

“Adoption took off faster than expected.”

“Quietly became a category leader.”

“Strong product, great timing.”

“Execution beat even optimistic forecasts.”

This should feel like what actually happened, not a score label.

2. Add context, not just the number

Right now it jumps straight to +$155,000, which is good, but it lacks story.

Consider adding one short line of context above or below the number, such as:

Why it worked

What surprised people

What the market reaction was

This reinforces the player’s decision-making, not just the math.

3. Visual style doesn’t fully match the game

This card feels more like a fintech dashboard than the rest of the game.

Suggestions:

Soften the box edges slightly or add a paper-like texture.

Reduce the “clean UI” feel and lean into the desk / note aesthetic.

Consider a subtle handwritten annotation or stamp (e.g. “Paid off” or “Good call”).

It should feel like a reveal, not a report.

4. The empty space weakens the moment

There’s a lot of unused space around the card, which makes the reveal feel quiet.

Possible fixes:

Slightly enlarge the card

Add faint background elements (scribbles, arrows, notes)

Bring the viewer’s eye more tightly to the outcome

This moment should feel focused.

5. Progress indicators are too subtle

“2 / 5 REVEALED” and “PORTFOLIO UPDATING…” are easy to miss.

Suggestions:

Make the progress indicator more prominent

Or phrase it more narratively, e.g.:

“2 of 5 outcomes revealed”

“Updating your portfolio…”

This helps pacing and anticipation.
