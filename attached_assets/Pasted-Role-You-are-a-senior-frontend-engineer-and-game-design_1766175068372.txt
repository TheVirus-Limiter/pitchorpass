Role:
You are a senior frontend engineer and game designer building a browser-based simulation game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Goal:
Design and implement a single-page web game called “10 Pitches”, where the player acts as a startup investor evaluating 10 startup pitches and deciding whether to invest.

🔹 Core Gameplay Requirements

The player starts with $100,000 in capital.

Exactly 10 founders appear one at a time.

Each founder:

Has a business-card style profile (photo, name, country).

Presents a short startup pitch (3–4 sentences).

Shows traction metrics (users, growth %, revenue).

The player must choose:

INVEST or PASS.

If INVEST, optionally choose an amount (slider or preset).

Decisions are final. No going back.

🔹 APIs to Use

Random User API for founder identity:

Name

Headshot

Country

ChatGPT API for startup generation:

Startup name

Pitch

Market category

Traction metrics

Hidden risk and upside values (not shown to player)

⚠️ The OpenAI API key must not be exposed in frontend code.
Assume a simple backend proxy or serverless function exists.

🔹 Data Model (Must Be Used)

Each pitch must be stored as an object with this structure:

{
  founder: {
    name: string,
    photo: string,
    country: string
  },
  startup: {
    name: string,
    pitch: string,
    market: string,
    traction: {
      users: number,
      monthlyGrowth: number,
      revenue: number
    },
    risk: number,     // 0–1, hidden from player
    upside: number    // multiplier, hidden from player
  },
  ask: number,
  decision: "invest" | "pass",
  investedAmount: number,
  outcome: null | number
}

🔹 ROI Simulation Logic

After all 10 pitches are completed:

Simulate outcomes using hidden risk and upside

Each invested startup results in:

Total failure

Break-even

Moderate return

Rare large win

Example logic (can be refined but must exist):

finalReturn = investedAmount * upside * (1 - risk) * randomVariance

🔹 Ending Experience (CRITICAL)

❌ Do NOT end with a numeric score only
✅ Must be interactive, animated, and story-driven

Required ending sequence:

“3 Years Later…” transition

Startups resolve one by one, each with:

Narrative event (e.g., “acquired”, “pivoted”, “shut down”)

Animated gain/loss applied to total capital

Final animated net-worth counter

Reveal an Investor Archetype, based on behavior:

Risk tolerance

Diversification

Capital efficiency

Examples:

“The Visionary”

“The Cautious Operator”

“The Degenerate Angel”

“The Accidental Genius”

Display a shareable summary screen with:

Final capital

Archetype

Notable wins/losses

🔹 UI / UX Expectations

Business-card layout for founders

Smooth transitions between pitches

Clear INVEST / PASS actions

Visual feedback on decisions (stamp, color, animation)

Timeline or card-based reveal for ending

Replayable without page refresh

🔹 Technical Constraints

HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript only

No frameworks

Use modern ES6 syntax

Clean separation of:

Data

Game state

UI rendering

Code must be readable and modular

🔹 Output Instructions

When responding:

Explain the architecture briefly

Provide folder structure

Provide key JS modules

Include sample prompts for the ChatGPT API

Do NOT skip the ending logic

🔹 Tone

Treat this as a real portfolio project, not a tutorial toy.
Assume the developer is capable and wants best practices.
