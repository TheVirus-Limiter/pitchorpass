Core Problems to Fix (Focused Feedback)
1. Reveal Screens Feel Flat and Repetitive

Right now, every reveal card follows the same emotional rhythm:

Big number

Simple line graph

Paragraph explanation

Headlines

Next button

This makes wins and losses feel mechanically identical.

Change request

Each reveal should emphasize a different failure or success pattern, not just a dollar outcome.

Add one distinct visual cue per outcome type:

Shutdown / Total Loss: faint cracked-paper texture, red pencil strike-through on the final year.

Acqui-hire: dotted valuation line that stops early + handwritten “team acquired” note.

Missed Opportunity: dashed green line with a ghosted final dot.

Big Win: thicker pencil stroke at the end + subtle highlight behind final value.

This keeps reveals emotionally distinct without adding new UI components.

2. Graphs Still Don’t Feel Hand-Drawn Enough

Even now, the charts look too clean and “library-generated.”

Change request

Replace perfectly straight segments with slightly uneven Bézier curves (small random offsets).

Add micro jitter to data points so no two points align perfectly.

Use soft pencil textures for strokes instead of solid vector lines.

Reduce axis opacity further and slightly misalign tick labels to feel sketched.

Important

These graphs should be static snapshots, not interactive.

Clicking or hovering must not mutate the graph or story text in any way.

3. Remove Interactive Markers That Change the Narrative

The circle, arrows, and clickable annotations are actively hurting the experience.

Change request

Remove:

All clickable points

Circles

Arrows

Tooltips

The reveal screen is a post-mortem, not an analysis tool.

Once revealed, the outcome must feel final and locked.

4. Explanatory Paragraphs Are Too Long and Too Similar

The narrative blocks read like generated summaries and blur together.

Change request

Cap reveal explanations at 3–4 short sentences max.

Structure them like:

What they tried to do

Where it went wrong or right

The specific reason for the outcome

Example direction (not exact copy):

“The idea showed early promise, but scaling costs rose faster than revenue.”

“Regulatory delays drained cash before follow-on funding closed.”

“A strong team made the tech valuable even after the business failed.”

Avoid repeating phrases like “revolutionized,” “promising,” “leading to” across companies.

5. “3 YEARS LATER” Needs Stronger Presence

Right now it fades into the background instead of anchoring the moment.

Change request

Increase its visual weight slightly:

Chalk or pencil lettering

Larger size

Slight diagonal placement

It should feel like someone wrote it on the desk before revealing results.

6. Valuation Progression Needs Clear Storytelling

The valuation labels like “$250K → $0” help, but they’re too passive.

Change request

Add one short label above the graph:

“Ran out of runway”

“Acquired for talent”

“Missed timing window”

“Scaled faster than expected”

This gives instant context before the user reads anything.

7. Wins and Losses Should Feel Asymmetrical

Losses currently feel almost as clean as wins.

Change request

For losses:

Reduce card brightness slightly

Increase contrast on the red loss number

Slightly compress vertical spacing (feels tighter, more uncomfortable)

For wins:

More breathing room

Softer shadows

Slightly warmer tone

The user should feel the difference immediately.

8. End Screen Still Feels Empty

The final portfolio screen is clean but emotionally underwhelming.

Change request

Add subtle background artifacts:

faint scribbled arrows

crossed-out numbers

small margin notes like “big bet paid off” or “too cautious here”

Include one sentence summary tied to playstyle:

“A few big decisions shaped everything.”

“Consistency beat instincts.”

“Risk paid off, but timing mattered.”

No charts needed here. This is reflection, not analysis.

High-Level Direction (So They Don’t Drift Again)

Guiding rule for reveal screens:

These are not dashboards.
They are receipts.

Each reveal should feel like flipping over a card and seeing how a story ended, not inspecting data.
