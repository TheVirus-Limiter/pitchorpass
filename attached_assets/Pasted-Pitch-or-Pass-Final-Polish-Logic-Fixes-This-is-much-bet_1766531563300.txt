Pitch or Pass — Final Polish & Logic Fixes

This is much better overall. The experience is finally cohesive. What’s left now are a few blocking polish and logic issues plus some content tuning. These are the last things before this feels “done.”

1. Right column spacing + PASS / INVEST buttons
A. Unused vertical space

There is still an annoying empty gap in the right column above the PASS / INVEST buttons.

This makes the decision area feel weak and unfinished.

Fix

Collapse the layout so the decision buttons sit immediately under:

Pro Tip / Exposure section

The right column should feel tight and pressurized, not airy.

B. PASS / INVEST buttons (almost there, but still off)

PASS

Visually fine, but still feels slightly disconnected.

Keep it understated, but clearly clickable.

INVEST

Green is correct.

Needs more visual emphasis than PASS.

This is the moment of commitment — it should feel weighty, not equal.

Do not over-style. Just clarify hierarchy.

2. Pro Tip / Exposure logic is wrong (math bug)

Current behavior:

“This would put 18% of your remaining capital into one bet.”

This is incorrect when:

User has $100,000

User invests $9,000
→ That is 9%, not 18%.

Required fix

Exposure must be calculated as:

investment_amount / remaining_capital


Not total portfolio

Not original starting capital

This text must always reflect the actual remaining cash, or it undermines trust.

3. Exit payoff callout needs more emphasis (great feature, underused)

This section:

If exit hits $10M →
Your take ≈ $1,590,909
(15.91% equity)


This is one of the coolest parts of the game, but it’s too easy to miss.

Improve by

Increasing font size slightly

Adding subtle visual emphasis:

Ink underline

Marker highlight

Small arrow or callout

Make it feel like a “holy shit” moment without being loud

This is where players feel the upside.

4. Founder conviction variety (content issue)

Right now, too many founders have:

“Data-driven, measured expectations”

This flattens the experience.

Required fix

Increase conviction diversity significantly.

Use AI to generate more varied, human-feeling traits, e.g.:

“Brilliant but defensive”

“Vision-first, details later”

“Calm, but evasive on numbers”

“Deeply technical, poor communicator”

“Overconfident, dismissive of risks”

“Quietly impressive, under-selling”

Conviction should feel like reading a person, not a rubric.

5. Endgame outcome messages are too generic

Most endings currently fall into:

“The company failed to execute.”

“Massive success.”

This wastes a huge opportunity.

Required change

Use AI to generate short, funny, case-specific outcome one-liners per company.

Examples of tone (not exact copy):

“The tech worked. The business didn’t.”

“Acquired for talent. Product quietly sunset.”

“Pivoted three times. Found product-market fit on the fourth.”

“Built a cult following. Never figured out distribution.”

“Regulators killed it. Investors didn’t.”

Each outcome should feel earned based on:

Risk level

Traction

Founder conviction

Your investment choice

6. End screen visual mismatch (theme break)

The end screen (“The Golden Touch”) is way off-theme.

Issues:

Feels like a fintech dashboard

Bright gradient clashes with paper/desk aesthetic

Bottom buttons are fogged out and feel disabled

Fix

Re-theme end screen to match the rest of the game:

Paper

Ink

Desk notes

Subtle highlights instead of gradients

Make bottom buttons clearly active and readable

The end should feel like:

You leaned back in your chair and looked at how you did
Not:
You finished onboarding for an app

Final checklist before sign-off

Remove right-column dead space

Fix exposure % calculation

Emphasize exit payoff callout

Increase founder conviction variety

Replace generic end messages with AI-generated outcomes

Re-theme end screen to match desk/paper aesthetic

Make end buttons clearly active
