1. Homepage: add creator credit

At the bottom of the home screen, add a small, subtle scribble that says:

made by rehan raj

Handwritten / scribble style

Low contrast

Feels like something casually written in the corner of the desk

This should feel personal, not like a footer.

2. Replace sticky note text (exact copy)

Please replace the sticky note content with the following verbatim.

Sticky note 1

Some founders are right.
A lot of them aren’t.

You’ll see the pitch, the traction,
and the valuation.

From there, it’s up to you
to decide if it’s worth backing.

Sticky note 2

Three years pass in just a few minutes.

Some companies grow steadily.
Some never really get going.
A few turn out better than expected.

You’ll see which bets paid off
and which ones didn’t.

Sticky note 3

By the end, you’ll have a sense
of the kind of investor you are.

Careful. Bold. Risk-taking. Lucky.
Or somewhere in between.

Your choices start to add up
and a pattern begins to show.

(Keep titles handwritten, body text normal, underlines only, no bold.)

3. PASS button hover bug

Right now:

When you hover PASS, it turns white

The text becomes unreadable

Fix

PASS hover state must preserve contrast

Text should always remain readable

If it’s a stamp, keep it consistent on hover

4. Game balance issue: you can invest in everything

Currently, you can invest ~$10k in all 10 companies and still be fine.
This removes tension and makes decisions too easy.

Please add a mechanic that forces tradeoffs, for example:

Minimum investment sizes increase later in the game

Some founders refuse small checks

Limited number of investments allowed (e.g. max 6–7)

Later rounds require larger commitments

The player should have to pass on some deals.

5. Pro Tip / Exposure math is still wrong

Example bug:

User invests $15k

Remaining capital is $81k

Pro Tip says this is 30% of capital

That’s incorrect.

Correct logic

investment_amount / remaining_capital


The Pro Tip must always reflect remaining cash, not starting capital or total portfolio.

6. Add “whiteboard notes” under Valuation Projection

Under the Valuation Projection section, add a small area that looks like
handwritten whiteboard notes you took while listening to the pitch.

These notes should:

Be short

Be practical

Help with the investment decision

Examples of note content (generated per pitch):

“Customer acquisition seems expensive”

“Strong growth, unclear margins”

“Depends heavily on partnerships”

“Tech risk is high but timing could be right”

This makes the page feel more like thinking, not just reading stats.

7. Highlight extremely low MRR

When a company has very low or $0k MRR:

Add a hand-drawn exclamation mark

Subtle, but clearly draws attention

Looks like it was scribbled next to the number

This should quietly signal risk without adding text.

Summary

What’s left is about:

Making choices matter

Fixing trust-breaking math bugs

Adding small visual cues that help decision-making

The overall direction is strong. These changes will push it from “good” to “feels right.”
