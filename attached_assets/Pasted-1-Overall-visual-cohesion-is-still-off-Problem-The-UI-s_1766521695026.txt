1. Overall visual cohesion is still off

Problem

The UI still reads as a modern SaaS dashboard.

Colors (green, blue, yellow, red) are competing instead of supporting a single material theme.

Cards look digitally “perfect” instead of tactile.

Fix

Commit fully to one material system:

Background: warm paper / light wood

Cards: off-white, manila, or light gray paper

Text: charcoal / graphite only

Accent color: muted red only for stamps and warnings

Remove or mute:

Bright green numbers

Bright blue outlines

High-saturation yellow panels

Nothing should look like a “success color” or “error color.” Let wording do the work.

2. Right column still feels like a metrics sidebar, not part of the room

Problem

“They’re asking,” “Valuation,” “Upside Potential,” etc. still feel like a fintech UI.

The yellow ROI note and exposure note look pasted on, not integrated.

Fix

Convert the entire right column into stacked paper notes, not boxed widgets.

Each section should feel pinned or taped:

Asking

Valuation

Upside

Your Equity

If exit hits $10M

Your Exposure

Slight rotation, subtle shadows, imperfect alignment.

Reduce labels and visual noise — fewer borders, more whitespace.

3. Exposure Warning needs refinement

Problem

The Exposure Warning exists, but it’s visually weak and blends into the ROI note.

It doesn’t feel like a “quiet warning.”

Fix

Make it its own small note under the ROI note.

Use:

Pencil/handwritten font

Muted red underline or small ⚠ stamp

Ensure only one sentence shows at a time.

Tone should feel like a human whisper, not a system alert.

4. Founder Conviction box is too UI-ish

Problem

The Founder Conviction section reads like another labeled metric.

The red box feels like a warning panel instead of an opinion.

Fix

Remove the solid red panel.

Present it as a handwritten note or margin comment, e.g.:

“Overconfident. Buzzword-heavy.”

No hard border. No filled background. Let it feel subjective and informal.

5. Graph section still breaks immersion

Problem

The valuation projection graph looks like a typical analytics chart.

It visually dominates the pitch.

Fix

De-emphasize the graph:

Thinner lines

Muted colors (graphite / dashed pencil style)

Less contrast

It should feel like something scribbled on a whiteboard, not a dashboard centerpiece.

6. Typography hierarchy needs tightening

Problem

Too many font weights and visual styles competing.

Some headers still feel “tech product.”

Fix

Limit to two fonts total:

Neutral sans (Inter / Source Sans / Plex) for most UI

Handwritten font for:

Sticky notes

Exposure warning

Conviction notes

Stamps

Reduce capitalization and heavy labels.

7. Stamps need to do more work

Problem

Stamps exist but don’t feel central.

Buttons still feel like standard UI buttons.

Fix

Lean harder into stamps:

INVESTED

PASS

ANSWERED

Make stamps:

Slightly rotated

Imperfect

Red ink

Buttons should feel secondary to stamps, not the other way around.

8. Homepage still feels flat and unfinished

Problems

Sticky notes are too evenly spaced and too clean.

Page feels empty despite content.

Footer text breaks immersion.

Fixes

Sticky notes

Increase rotation variance.

Add subtle tape/pins.

Let them overlap slightly.

Whitespace

Pull the notes slightly higher.

Reduce empty space above and below.

Remove footer text

Delete the line:

10 Pitches • The Investment Game


The homepage should end cleanly with no footer tagline.

9. Content is good — don’t rewrite it

The sticky note copy on the homepage is good and should not be rewritten.
The pitch text tone is also good.

This is now a design execution problem, not a writing problem.
