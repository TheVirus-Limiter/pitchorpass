Update the final results screen to better match the handmade, investor-journal theme of the game.

Make the following changes exactly:

Tone & Language

Remove marketing language such as “golden touch,” “legendary,” “handsomely,” or anything that sounds like a SaaS landing page.

Replace with grounded, human phrasing that reflects decisions made during play.

Keep sentences short and natural. Avoid em dashes and overly dramatic wording.

Archetype Presentation

Keep the archetype title at the top, but add 2 to 3 short lines explaining why the player earned it.

These lines must reference behavior such as risk tolerance, concentration of bets, traction focus, or founder conviction patterns.

Archetypes should feel earned, not assigned.

Visual Style

Reduce confetti opacity by at least 60 percent or replace it with a subtle paper texture or faint stamp marks.

Avoid glossy gradients. Use softer, paper-like color fills.

The screen should feel like closing a notebook, not winning a mobile game.

Numbers & Context

Keep Final Net Worth as the main number.

Add a subtle line above or below it that says:
“Started with $100,000”

Keep Return Multiple and Profit, but reduce their visual dominance slightly.

Decision Summary

Add a short section titled “What shaped this outcome” with 2 to 3 bullet points.

These bullets should be generated dynamically from gameplay patterns (example: concentrated bets, avoided hype, favored revenue).

Buttons

Make “Play Again” the clear primary action.

Keep “Home” secondary but fully readable.

Buttons should feel intentional, not fogged or disabled.

The final screen should feel reflective, personal, and consistent with the pitch and note-taking experience throughout the game.
