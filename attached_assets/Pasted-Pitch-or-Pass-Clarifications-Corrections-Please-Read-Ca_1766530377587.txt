Pitch or Pass — Clarifications + Corrections (Please Read Carefully)

I want to reset a few things because some changes went in the wrong direction and others misunderstood the intent. Below is what to revert, what to fix, and what to change going forward.

1. CTA / Buttons — revert + adjust, don’t overdesign
A. Main CTA (“Take a seat”)

The current button is worse than before.

I am fine with a standard CTA button here.

Do this instead

Make it a clean, readable CTA.

No weird borders, no awkward framing.

It should clearly look clickable, nothing gimmicky.

Simple > ugly “creative.”

B. PASS / INVEST buttons (pitch page)

PASS

The previous PASS was fine.

It should exist.

If it’s a stamp, great — but it must still be clearly clickable.

INVEST

Needs improvement, but don’t overdo it.

Green is fine.

Clear intent: this is the action.

Still should not feel like a default SaaS button, but do not make it ugly.

Also:

There is still too much empty space between:

Pro Tip

PASS / INVEST
Tighten this column.

2. Sticky Notes — font usage is backwards right now

This is important because it’s been implemented incorrectly.

Correct rule (non-negotiable):

Sticky note TITLES → handwritten style

Sticky note BODY TEXT → normal, readable font

Right now it’s reversed or inconsistent.

Additionally:

The sticky note body text MUST include:

Underlines

Occasional bold / emphasis
(Not everything, just enough to add character.)

Example intent:

Some are right.
Most are wrong.

This is about rhythm and personality, not decoration.

3. Homepage still needs more life (but don’t clutter)

The homepage is improving, but it’s still too flat.

Add subtle background elements:

Light sketches

Faint charts

Numbers

Money marks

Whiteboard scribbles

These should be very low contrast, almost subconscious — not loud illustrations.

4. Top HUD elements still don’t match the theme
A. “Round 1/10” (top left)

The blue pill does not belong.

Too modern.

Fix

Convert to:

Paper tag

Desk label

Light stamp

Color is fine, but it must fit the paper/desk theme.

B. “$100,000” purse (top right)

The green pill is too UI-heavy.

Fix

Keep the green (I like it).

Make it feel:

Printed

Labeled

Pinned or tagged
Not a floating app badge.

5. Pitch page issues that must be addressed
A. Founder Conviction

This is now mostly correct visually, but:

It must be clearly labeled

It must be immediately noticeable

Make sure:

The label “Founder Conviction” is readable.

The color of the sticky note communicates the meaning.

B. Risk Assessment

The faint color undertone is good.

Keep:

Red = high

Yellow = medium

Green = low
Subtle is fine, but it must be present.

C. Pro Tip (Exposure Warning)

The design direction is better.

Still needs to feel more like advice, less like an alert.

Reduce dead space between this and the decision buttons.

6. Graph bugs and visuals (still blocking)
A. Graph line colors

Good direction, but make sure all paths are clearly distinguishable.

Muted colors only (green/red/blue is fine).

B. Critical bug (still present)

Typing in any input (Ask the founder one question) is still changing:

Graph points

Projection numbers

This must be fixed immediately:

Pitch data must be frozen once loaded.

Inputs must NOT trigger recomputation.

7. Remove things that don’t belong

The lightning bolt near the founder photo should be removed.

Any leftover modern UI pills/icons should be audited and replaced.

Summary — what I want next

For the next iteration, please focus on:

Reverting the overdesigned CTA

Fixing sticky note font hierarchy (title handwritten, body normal + underlines)

Cleaning up PASS / INVEST (not removing them)

Theming the top HUD elements properly

Fixing the graph bug permanently

Adding subtle background life to the homepage

The direction is right, but right now execution is fighting the idea. Simpler, clearer, and more intentional will get us there faster.

If anything above is unclear, please ask before implementing again.
