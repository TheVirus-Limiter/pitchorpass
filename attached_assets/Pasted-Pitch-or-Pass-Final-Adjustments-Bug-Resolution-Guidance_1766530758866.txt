Pitch or Pass — Final Adjustments + Bug Resolution Guidance

This iteration is closer. Now we need to lock correctness and consistency. Below are specific final changes and how to resolve the remaining blockers.

1. Homepage fixes (small but important)
A. Capital display

Remove the text “Starting Capital:”

Display only $100,000

Keep it styled like a pinned/printed element, not a UI pill.

B. CTA text

Change “Take a seat” → “Begin” or “Start”

Keep it a standard, clean CTA

No decorative borders or frames

It should look obviously clickable, nothing fancy.

C. Sticky notes (homepage)

Clarify this exactly:

Titles → handwritten (keep this)

Body text → normal readable font (current direction is correct)

Remove all bolding from sticky note body text

Keep underlines only for emphasis

Add subtle undertone variation (slightly different paper warmth per note)

D. Background elements

The background elements are a good idea, but:

Reduce contrast

Make them feel like faint desk/whiteboard artifacts

The € symbol on the left is too bold

Reduce opacity significantly

It should barely register

2. Top HUD elements (still incorrect)
A. “Round 1/10” (top left)

Still too modern and blue.

Must be converted into:

A paper tag / label

Muted ink color

No pill-style UI.

B. $100,000 (top right)

Still reads as a modern app badge.

Keep green, but:

Make it look printed, tagged, or pinned

Less saturation

Less “floating UI” feel

These two elements must visually belong to the desk theme.

3. Founder Conviction — color logic fix

Current state:

Text: “Overconfident, buzzword-heavy”

This must be RED.

Founder Conviction color should strictly follow meaning:

Green → grounded / thoughtful

Yellow → mixed signals

Red → overconfident / risky

The entire sticky note should reflect this.

This is a semantic error, not stylistic.

4. PASS / INVEST regression

We went backward here.

PASS

Bring PASS back clearly.

Stamp-style is fine, but it must be present and clickable.

INVEST

Green is correct.

Still needs refinement, but:

Do not over-style

Do not remove clarity

Tighten spacing — there is empty vertical space below these buttons that should be removed.

5. Graph bug — must be permanently fixed

This is the biggest remaining issue.

Problem

Typing in any input (Ask the founder one question) still:

Changes graph points

Changes projections

Recomputes pitch data

This breaks the game logic.

Required architectural fix (pick one)
Option A (preferred): Freeze pitch state

When a pitch loads:

Generate pitch data once

Store it in immutable state (e.g. pitchData)

Graph should render only from pitchData

Text inputs must not trigger pitch regeneration

Option B: Separate concerns explicitly

Separate state into:

pitchState (generated once)

uiState (inputs, typing, sliders)

Ensure graph subscribes only to pitchState

Inputs must not touch pitch generation logic

Option C: Lock graph data after render

On initial render:

Cache graph series

On subsequent renders:

Reuse cached values unless pitch ID changes

Non-negotiable:
Typing must NEVER affect pitch data. If this isn’t fixed, the game doesn’t work.

6. Summary — final checklist

For the next update, I expect:

$100,000 only (no “Starting Capital” text)

CTA text changed to “Begin” or “Start”

No bold text in sticky note bodies (underlines only)

Reduced prominence of background symbols

Round + capital HUD elements themed properly

Founder Conviction color corrected (red for overconfident)

PASS restored, INVEST refined, spacing tightened

Graph bug permanently resolved using one of the approaches above

At this point the direction is clear — the remaining work is precision and discipline, not new ideas.
