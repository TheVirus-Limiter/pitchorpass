1. Sticky note emphasis and structure (important)

For each sticky note, the first line should be both bolded and underlined. Specifically:

“Some founders are right.”

“Three years pass in just a few minutes.”

“By the end, you’ll have a sense of the kind of investor you are.”

These should act as the anchor of each note.

Whiteboard note body text changes

Increase the overall text size of whiteboard note content.

Each note should have 3–4 short sentences that give more context, not just a summary.

Notes should feel like quick observations you scribbled while listening.

Required content rules for notes:

At least one line must be negative or skeptical about the company.

Higher-risk companies can have multiple skeptical lines.

Tone should be realistic, not dramatic.

Example intent (not exact copy):

Mentions traction but questions sustainability

Notes strong idea but unclear execution

Calls out pricing, margins, or dependency risk

This makes the notes actually useful for decision-making.

2. Low MRR visual callout

When a company has very low or $0 MRR:

Add three hand-drawn exclamation marks (!!!) near the MRR value.

Scribbled style, subtle but noticeable.

This should immediately flag concern without adding text.

3. Founder credentials section (new)

Under the founder name / location, add a small section labeled something like:

Credentials

This should include 1–2 short bullet-style lines, for example:

“MBA, Harvard Business School”

“BS Computer Science, UT Austin”

“Former software engineer at Google”

“Previously worked at Microsoft”

Important rules:

Sprinkle in strong universities (Harvard, Stanford, MIT, UT Austin, Berkeley, etc.).

Sprinkle in big tech experience (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon).

These should slightly increase perceived credibility, but:

Not all great startups have great credentials

Include some outliers:

Unknown schools

No-name companies

Self-taught founders

This creates realism and forces players to decide how much credentials actually matter.

4. Risk alignment

Companies with stronger credentials can tend to:

Have lower execution risk

Be more polished

But do not make this deterministic.

There should be cases where:

Great credentials still fail

Weak credentials lead to surprising success
