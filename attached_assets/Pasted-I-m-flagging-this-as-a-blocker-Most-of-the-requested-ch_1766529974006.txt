I’m flagging this as a blocker. Most of the requested changes were not implemented, and several known bugs are still present. Before moving forward, these issues must be resolved exactly as specified below.

1. Multiple requested changes were not applied at all
A. PASS / INVEST buttons

Status: ❌ Not changed

PASS still has a button container.

INVEST is still a modern UI button.

No green/decisive visual language for INVEST.

No meaningful stamp interaction.

Required fix

PASS = stamp only, no button container.

INVEST = clearly different, decisive action:

Green stamp or bold ink

Heavier visual weight than PASS

These must not resemble standard web buttons.

B. Founder Conviction implementation is incorrect

Status: ❌ Incorrect

Founder Conviction is now inside another box.

It is visually buried.

The color coding is weak and unclear.

Required fix

Founder Conviction must be its own standalone sticky note, not nested.

It must include a visible label:

Founder Conviction


The entire note must be color-coded by conviction:

Green = grounded

Yellow = mixed

Red = overconfident

Increase text size significantly.

This is a core mechanic and must be immediately legible.

C. Exposure Warning design still wrong

Status: ❌ Not implemented as requested

Still looks like a warning box.

Still too small.

Still separated from the decision area.

Still too much dead space above/below.

Required fix

Redesign as a “Pro Tip / Investor Note” style component.

Larger text.

Softer visual language.

Visually connected to PASS / INVEST.

Use the available vertical space — the right column should feel dense and pressurized.

2. Graph issues are still unresolved (critical)
A. Graph line colors

Status: ❌ Not changed

All lines are still effectively the same color.

Required fix

Use subtle but distinct colors:

Historical → neutral graphite

Conservative → muted blue

Realistic → muted green

Optimistic → muted red

Low saturation only — still whiteboard-style.

B. Graph values still change when typing

Status: ❌ Bug still present

This is now the third time this issue has appeared.

Required fix (non-negotiable)

Pitch data (including projections and graph points) must be immutable once loaded.

Typing in any input field must:

NOT regenerate pitch data

NOT recompute projections

NOT re-render graph values

If needed, freeze the pitch object after load. This must be fixed before any visual polish continues.

3. Modern UI elements still breaking immersion
A. “Round 1/10” and “$100,000” HUD

Status: ⚠️ Partially improved, still too modern

Required fix

These should feel like:

Paper tags

Desk notes

Stamped or annotated elements

Add subtle color, but stay within the paper/ink theme.

Remove pill-style SaaS UI look.

B. Lightning bolt near founder photo

Status: ❌ Still present

Required fix

Remove entirely. It has no meaning and adds noise.

4. Homepage issues still outstanding
A. Sticky note body text font not changed

Status: ❌ Not implemented

Sticky note body text is still handwritten.

No bold / underline / emphasis as requested.

Required fix

Change sticky note body text to a more notable, readable font (not handwritten).

Use:

Bold

Italics

Underlines
sparingly for emphasis and rhythm.

The notes should be read, not just glanced at.

B. Homepage background is still bland

Status: ❌ Not implemented

Required fix

Add creative background elements:

Faint sketches

Doodles

Charts

Numbers

Currency symbols

Whiteboard marks

The page should feel like a workspace, not a flat gradient.

C. “Take a seat” is still not a button

Status: ❌ Still unclear affordance

It does not read as clickable.

It looks like decoration.

Required fix

Make it unmistakably a button:

Stronger shadow

Clear edges

Bolder text

It should feel like starting the game, not reading a note.

5. Summary — what must happen next

Before continuing, the next iteration must:

Actually implement the PASS / INVEST redesign

Fix Founder Conviction as a standalone, color-coded note

Redesign Exposure Warning as a Pro Tip and use the space

Fix graph line colors

Permanently fix the graph-changing-on-typing bug

Remove modern UI remnants (pills, icons, bolts)

Make the homepage visually creative and intentional

Make “Take a seat” a real button

Change sticky note body font and add emphasis styling

Right now, the issue is not misunderstanding the direction — it’s execution not matching the instructions.

If any of the above is unclear, please ask before implementing.
