1. Text size is too small across the app (major usability failure)

Problem

Pitch text, metrics, labels, and notes are all too small.

The app feels dense and uncomfortable to read.

This is a game, not a financial terminal.

Fix

Increase base font size globally.

Target:

Pitch body text: 16–18px

Key numbers (users, revenue, equity): 18–22px

Section headers: 14–16px

Prioritize breathing room over fitting everything on screen.

If it looks “too big,” that’s usually correct for this style.

2. Color system is still wrong (stop using green / blue / purple)

Problem

Green (risk, growth, buttons), blue (outlines, chips), and purple (MRR) are still present.

These colors directly contradict the physical, analog theme.

It looks like a fintech SaaS UI pasted onto a paper background.

Fix (non-negotiable)

Remove all semantic colors:

No green = good

No red = danger (except stamps)

No blue = information

Use:

Paper tones (off-white / manila / light gray)

Ink tones (charcoal / graphite)

Muted red only for stamps and subtle warnings

Numbers should be black/graphite.
Risk should be communicated with words, not color blocks.

3. Risk Assessment should not be a colored panel

Problem

“Low Risk” in green is visually loud and misleading.

It reads like a recommendation.

Fix

Remove the colored background entirely.

Present risk as simple text:

Risk Assessment: Low

Optionally add a pencil underline or margin note.

Risk should feel informational, not advisory.

4. Graph is unreadable and incoherent

Problems

All projection lines are the same color.

No visual distinction between scenarios.

Graph dominates attention without clarity.

Fix

De-emphasize the graph visually:

Thinner strokes

Muted graphite tones

Differentiate scenarios by line style, not color:

Solid = historical

Dashed = conservative

Dotted = optimistic

Reduce opacity so it feels like a whiteboard sketch, not analytics software.

The graph should support the pitch, not compete with it.

5. Buttons still look like modern UI buttons

Problem

Green INVEST button feels like a call-to-action banner.

PASS button feels like a danger/secondary action.

Fix

Remove green and blue button styles.

Buttons should look like:

Paper tabs

Pencil-labeled actions

The stamp should be the emotional feedback, not the button color.

6. Founder Conviction & Exposure are still visually weak

Problem

Conviction text is small and visually buried.

Exposure warning does not stand out as a “pause and think” moment.

Fix

Increase text size.

Present both as handwritten notes or margin comments.

Use red ink sparingly (underline, stamp, scribble) to draw attention.

These are psychological cues — they should be readable at a glance.

7. Typography hierarchy needs to be reset

Problem

Too many small text styles competing.

Feels compressed and technical.

Fix

Reduce hierarchy complexity:

Fewer font sizes

More spacing

Headings should clearly stand apart.

Body text should never feel cramped.

8. Theme discipline is being violated

Reminder
This app should feel like:

A pitch room

A whiteboard

Paper notes and stamps

Human judgment and uncertainty

It should not feel like:

A fintech dashboard

An analytics tool

A growth metrics app

If a UI element looks like it belongs in Stripe, Notion, or a trading app, it does not belong here.

Definition of “done” for the next iteration

All text is easily readable without strain

No bright green, blue, or purple anywhere

Graph is legible and subdued

Risk and conviction feel subjective, not prescriptive

UI feels calm, analog, and intentional

Please focus entirely on readability, color discipline, and restraint before adding or tweaking anything else.
