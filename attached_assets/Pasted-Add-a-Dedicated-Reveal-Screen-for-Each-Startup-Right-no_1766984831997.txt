Add a Dedicated “Reveal” Screen for Each Startup

Right now, outcomes appear too abruptly. To improve pacing and emotional payoff, each startup should have its own short reveal screen before the portfolio updates.

How the Reveal Screen Should Work

After finishing a phase (or at the 3-years-later moment):

Reveal one startup at a time

Each reveal gets its own focused screen

The player clicks to move to the next reveal

This turns outcomes into moments, not lines in a list.

Structure of a Single Reveal Screen

Each startup reveal should include:

1. Clear headline (company name)

Example:

SomniSense

This anchors the moment.

2. Short context line (what you did)

Example:

You invested $31,000 for 12.40% equity

Keeps the player oriented.

3. Outcome number (the payoff)

Example:

+$155,000

This should still be the visual focus.

4. Case-specific outcome line (not generic)

Replace labels like “MASSIVE SUCCESS” with one human sentence, for example:

“Adoption accelerated faster than expected.”

“Quietly became a default choice for sleep clinics.”

“Strong retention carried growth when marketing stalled.”

This makes the result feel earned.

5. Optional small annotation (flavor)

Very light, optional, handwritten-style notes like:

“Good timing.”

“Right bet.”

“Risk paid off.”

Use sparingly.

Visual / UX Guidance

The reveal screen should:

Feel focused

Remove distractions

Center the card on screen

Background can stay minimal, but:

Slight paper texture

Subtle vignette

This should feel like pausing to look at one decision, not skimming results.

Pacing Suggestions (Optional)

Add a brief delay or fade-in for:

Company name

Then the number

This builds anticipation without needing animation-heavy effects.

Why This Matters

This change:

Makes outcomes memorable

Reinforces cause-and-effect

Gives weight to each decision

Prevents results from feeling like a spreadsheet update

Each reveal should feel like:

“Okay… what happened to this one?”

After All Reveals

Only after all startups are revealed:

Update total portfolio value

Show archetype

Show summary screen

This keeps narrative flow clean and satisfying.
